# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Structure

This is a **multi-crate workspace** with two git submodules:

- **`phi-core/`** — The core Rust library for building AI agents. Published as `phi-core` on crates.io. This is where most development happens. Has its own detailed `CLAUDE.md` — read it for phi-core-specific architecture, types, and conventions.
- **`baby-phi/`** — A standalone Rust binary that consumes `phi-core` (its own embedded agent implementation in `agent.rs`). Config-driven via `config.toml`. An early consumer/prototype, not the primary focus.

## Build & Development

All cargo commands must use the cargo binary at `/root/rust-env/cargo/bin/cargo`. There is no Docker container.

```bash
# phi-core (the main crate — run from phi-core/)
cd phi-core
/root/rust-env/cargo/bin/cargo build
/root/rust-env/cargo/bin/cargo test
/root/rust-env/cargo/bin/cargo test <test_name>              # single test by name
/root/rust-env/cargo/bin/cargo test --test session_test      # single test file
/root/rust-env/cargo/bin/cargo fmt
/root/rust-env/cargo/bin/cargo fmt -- --check
RUSTFLAGS="-Dwarnings" /root/rust-env/cargo/bin/cargo clippy --all-targets

# baby-phi (run from baby-phi/)
cd baby-phi
/root/rust-env/cargo/bin/cargo build
/root/rust-env/cargo/bin/cargo run
```

CI treats all clippy warnings as errors (`RUSTFLAGS="-Dwarnings"`). Always run clippy before considering work complete.

## phi-core Architecture (Summary)

phi-core is organized as three conceptual layers within one crate (dependencies flow strictly downward):

- **Layer 1 — Core Loop** (`types/`, `agent_loop/`, `provider/traits.rs`): The stateless agent loop, `AgentTool` trait, `StreamProvider` trait, message/event types. Provider-agnostic, tool-agnostic.
- **Layer 2 — Agent + Providers** (`agents/`, `context/`, `provider/*.rs`, `tools/`, `mcp/`): 7 concrete LLM providers, 6 built-in tools, `Agent` trait + `BasicAgent`, MCP client, context management, session persistence.
- **Layer 3 — Orchestration** (planned): Multi-agent coordination, config-driven invocation, WASM plugins.

Key design: `agent_loop()` and `agent_loop_continue()` are **free functions**, not methods. `BasicAgent` is a stateful wrapper that builds `AgentLoopConfig` and calls these functions. The `Agent` trait is the runtime interface (prompting, state, control).

## Specification Documents

Detailed specs live in `phi-core/docs/specs/`:
- `developer/overview.md` — Entity hierarchy, status tags (`[EXISTS]`/`[PLANNED]`/`[CONCEPTUAL]`), core gaps (G1-G9)
- `developer/{agent,session,loop,turn,message,tool,provider,event,compaction,config}.md` — Per-entity deep dives
- `platform/{invocation,plugins,multi-user}.md` — Platform evolution specs (config layer, WASM plugins, multi-user)
- `architecture.md` — Component maps, sequence diagrams
- `roadmap.md` — Requirements tracking (REQ-001+)

Architecture docs in `phi-core/docs/architecture/overview.md` include First Principles for core vs external decisions.

## Key Conventions

- **Submodule awareness**: `phi-core` and `baby-phi` are git submodules. Commits happen inside each submodule, then the parent repo tracks the submodule commit reference.
- **Testing**: All tests use `MockProvider` for deterministic LLM simulation. No network calls in unit tests. Integration tests (`tests/integration_anthropic.rs`) require a live API key and are skipped by default.
- **Session persistence**: `Session` → `LoopRecord` → `Turn` hierarchy. `SessionRecorder` materializes `Turn` structs from `TurnStart`/`TurnEnd` event pairs. All session types use `#[serde(default)]` for backward-compatible deserialization.
- **Hook ordering**: Lifecycle callbacks fire strictly before their paired events. `Before*` hooks returning `false` abort the action. This ordering is a system invariant — never break it.
